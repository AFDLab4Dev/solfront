# solfront
Javascript/Leaflet frontend for OpenSolarMap

The goal of this web frontend is to allow contributor to determine roof orientation in order to select North/South facing roofs and flat ones which are the best ones to cover with solar panels.

This UI interacts with a backend database containing building footprints extracted from OpenStreetMap data.
The imagery used comes from DigitalGlobe thru Mapbox.

After gathering enough roof orientation submissions, the resulting data will be uploaded to OpenStreetMap data.
